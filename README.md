DogeBox is a unique blockchain-based platform that allows users to immortalize and preserve their favorite memes as `NFTs`, locking them in a `digital time capsule` to be opened at a future date. By blending humor with technology, this project provides a way to preserve internet culture and meme history, capturing moments that resonate with audiences today for rediscovery tomorrow.

At its core, the project uses `NFTs` (Non-Fungible Tokens) and `IPFS` (InterPlanetary File System) to securely store memes on the blockchain. When users upload a meme, it is stored on IPFS and minted as an NFT, then “`locked`” in a `smart contract` with a specified unlock date. The NFT and its metadata, including IPFS storage and the unlock timestamp, ensure that the meme remains hidden until the selected future date. Upon reaching the unlock time, the meme becomes accessible to everyone, creating an exciting and nostalgic experience.
